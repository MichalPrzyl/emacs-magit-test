* Terminal

- There is M-x `shell` command. It is spawning shell where you can use emacs bindings.
- M-x `term` is asking what shell to spawn. But then you cannot use M-x anymore. You have to `exit` the shell.
- M-x `eshell` is spawning lightweight shell with emacs binding.
- There is also `vterm` which is the best. It's like tmux inside emacs.
  Installation of `vterm`:
  #+BEGIN_SRC <język>
(use-package vterm
  :ensure t)
  #+END_SRC

* Bufers
So simple:
- `C-x <left>`
- `C-x <right>`

* Wrapping lines
Just enter `visual-line-mode` in `M-x`

* Line operations
Usuwanie całej linii, nawet będąc w jej środku
C-S-backspace
